# PremierLeague_data

This repository is for analysing historic premier league data from 93/94 --> 21/22

Things to achieve;
- find win rates of premier league teams
- what teams have been in the premier league and for how long
- how many goals scored and conceded per team (avg per season)
- most common days played on
- how the time played changes
- compare several stats and how they've changed over time
